<h1>Registartion Form</h1>
<p>
  As part of my internship with Bharat Intern, I successfully completed Task 1, which involved developing a responsive registration form website. The project focused on designing a user-friendly interface with key features such as comprehensive form fields, robust client-side and server-side validation, and secure data handling. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend leveraged Node.js and Express.js for form processing and validation. Database integration ensured secure data storage. This experience allowed me to refine my skills in full-stack development, user interface design, and web security, contributing to my growth as a web developer.
